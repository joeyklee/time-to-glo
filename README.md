# Transit Glow Light

## About
The Transit Glow Light is a light installation that uses varying intensities of light to indicate to people when they should leave their homes to catch the public transit near them. The light is actuated by real-time data from the [VAG](https://www.vag.de/) - the Neurnberg public transit agency.

The project was supported and completed as part of the [Hackbay Hackathon](https://www.hackbay.de/) by [Zollhof](https://www.zollhof.de/). 

## Setup:
